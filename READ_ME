INSTRUCTIONS:

In this assignment you will be creating an automation script for signing up and logging into the application.
Do not write any code here in Replit. Create the code in your own IntelliJ, once finished, push the code to your own repository and share the repository link here (your repo must be public) in a given repoLink.txt file and submit.


STEPS:
1. Navigate to http://duotify.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/register.php
2. Verify the the title is "Welcome to Duotify!" (Use Assert class methods for all assertions)
3. Click on Signup here
4. Fill out the form with the required info
5. (You might want to use Faker class for that purpose since the data has to be different every time because the application does not allow you to sign up with the same username or email more than once)
6. Click on Sign up
7. Once logged in to the application, verify that the URL is:
http://duotify.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/browse.php?
8. In the left navigation bar, verify that your first and last name matches the first and last name that you used when signing up.
9. Click on the username on the left navigation bar and verify the username on the main window is correct and then click logout.
10. Verify that you are logged out by verifying the URL is:
http://duotify.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/register.php
11. Login using the same username and password when you signed up.
12. Verify successful login by verifying that the home page contains the text "You Might Also Like".
13. Log out once again and verify that you are logged out.
